*Elastic Stack SIEM Integration with Kali Linux*

- **Tools & Technologies**: Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Filebeat, Kali Linux, VirtualBox
  
- **Resources**:
  - Step-by-step guide: *A Simple Elastic SIEM Lab* by Abdullahi Ali ([link](https://medium.com/@aali23/a-simple-elastic-siem-lab-6765159ee2b2))
  - Walk-through video: Dr. Gerald Auger, Ph.D. ([video](https://youtu.be/2XLzMb9oZBI?si=OO-2s8ScBa7J5ghW))
 
- **Project Overview**: Developed, deployed, and configured an Elastic Stack-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system integrated with Kali Linux. The project focused on leveraging open-source tools to enhance security visibility and monitor system logs for potential threats.

- **Problem Solved**: Created a centralized logging and monitoring solution that addresses the challenge of detecting and responding to security incidents in real-time, improving an organization's ability to handle cyber threats and perform incident response.

- **Key Steps**:
  - I followed Abdullahi Ali’s step-by-step lab guide on configuring Elastic stack for log storage and search capabilities.
  - Deployed Logstash to collect, parse, and transform security event data from various sources.
  - Configured Filebeat on Kali Linux to forward log data, including system and application logs, to Elastic Stack.
  - Created custom visualizations and real-time dashboards in Kibana to monitor security events and analyze logs for suspicious activity.
  - I used Kali Linux for simulated attacks and tested the Elastic Stack SIEM’s threat detection and alerting mechanisms.

**Outcome**
- Improved the ability to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats through a robust, open-source SIEM solution. This project provided hands-on experience in deploying a fully functional SIEM that can be scaled for enterprise use.
- ***Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration and Management***: Successfully set up and configured Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment. Demonstrated proficiency in deploying a Kali Linux VM, configuring Elastic Agents for log collection, and forwarding data to the SIEM for effective security event monitoring.
- ***Security Event Simulation and Analysis***: Acquired hands-on experience in generating and analyzing security events using Nmap on Kali Linux. Proficient in querying Elastic SIEM to identify and investigate security incidents, enhancing skills in network security monitoring and threat detection.
- ***Visualization and Alerting in SIEM***: Developed a custom dashboard in Elastic SIEM to visualize security events, demonstrating data interpretation and pattern recognition skills. Successfully created and tested alert rules for detecting specific security events, showing competency in proactive incident response and alert management.
